<h1>User Web Search Analysis Simulation</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This is my first Data Analysis project after completing my Data Analysis certificate from the Management Institute of Finance and Technology.
The project showcases basic data analysis of user web search analysis with categorization, click through rate, and more.
<br />


<h2> Applications and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Google Colab</b> 
- <b>Python</b>
- <b>Matplotlib</b>
- <b>Pandas</b>
- <b>Seaborn</b>
- <b>Excel</b>

  
<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>
This project simulates and analyzes web search query data using Python. A mock dataset was created with fields like query text, country, device type, search engine, timestamp, impressions, and clicks
In the project i calculate and visualize Click-Through Rate (CTR), analyzes search behavior by country, device, and category.I then display insights through charts like, bar plots, and box plots.
This also demonstrates basic data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn that will also be expanded on in the future with other advanced concepts like Machine Learning and Operational Research methods.
